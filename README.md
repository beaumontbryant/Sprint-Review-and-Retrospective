# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
This is one of the most useful ideas from this course. I think it is mainly about fixing issues and improving or adding features. The value is that users, especially non-technical, will tell you what they want or the problems they have in a non-technical way. "The webpage is slow." or "I don't like having to go here to do this." As the developer you need to be able to interperet that. It also shows what is actually important. 


2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I really appreciate all of it. The bigger peices are daily meetings, and sprint planning. Let's formulate our goals and plan them based on priority and difficulty. Then lets meet daily and discuss what is going well, and where do we need help.


3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member is multifaceted. You want to give people flexibility (psychological safety) to admit to issues and failures. That allows you to be open as well. But it is also a desire to see the team win together and not be competitve with your teammates. You aren't trying to beat them, you are all trying to accomplish something together.
